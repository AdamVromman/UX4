      A Smart City Solution needs an audience. That target audience is the very
      basis upon which we build our project, so it was important to describe it
      well and early.

    <p>
      Since we had an idea in our mind that revolved around connecting a
      neighbourhood, we naturally started thinking about people that have a hard
      time connecting to their neighbourhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      During emergencies like the Covid pandemic, droughts or floods, people are
      often forced to stay inside more than usual. Visiting friends and family
      is usually not possible and the risk of loneliness for people living
      alone, increases.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="absolute text-white left-[800px] top-[30%]">
    <p>
      Although we let go of the idea of emergencies early on, this group of
      people stuck with us. We started thinking of how to connect the city
      itself with the people that don't have the ability to visit the most
      vibrant parts of the city.
    </p>
    <p>This is what we came up with:</p>
  </div>
  <div class="p-20 absolute flex flex-col gap-40 bg-orange text-grey right-0">
    <p>Our target audience became elderly people, that lived alone.</p>
